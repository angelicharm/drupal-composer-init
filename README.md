This plugin provides a new composer command (`drupal-init`) which helps in creating new Drupal installations based on composer. Most of the options are very similar to the default `composer init` command. There are additional options to specify a Drupal core or distro to use and the docroot.

This plugin also supports Drupal 7 installation but this option needs to be passed in from command line.

The composer.json setup that this plugin generates is inspired by [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) (both D7 and D8 versions). One important difference is that the composer.json generated by this command does not need several scripts which are part of the drupal-composer project. All the functionality is moved to [hussainweb/drupal-composer-helper](https://github.com/hussainweb/drupal-composer-helper). There are additional benefits like a simpler `extra` section and a more maintainable installation. For more details, see the [drupal-composer-helper](https://github.com/hussainweb/drupal-composer-helper) plugin.

## Installation

Since this plugin provides a new composer command that should be used in an empty directory (or at least a directory without a composer.json setup), this has to be installed globally.

```
composer global require hussainweb/drupal-composer-init:~1.0
```

## Updating

```
composer global update hussainweb/drupal-composer-init --with-dependencies
```

## Usage

In a fresh directory, run this command to get started.

```
composer drupal-init
```

To intialise a Drupal 7 website, run the following command:

```
composer drupal-init --drupal-7
```

### Specifying extensions (modules, themes, profiles)

Drupal extensions such as modules, themes, and profiles can be specified in the regular `require` or `require-dev` section of composer.json schema.

All Drupal extensions can be specified in the regular packages section with their drupal.org name prefixed by '`drupal/`'. For example, if you want to require panels module, specify `drupal/panels`.

```
